This repository compares four implementations of the LOF unsupervised anomoly detection algorithm, with the goal of finding the quickest while most 'correct enough implementation of the algorithm.' Please read the paper included in this respository for exact details, but in the end, I found that an implementation optimized by numpy using a KD tree for nearest neighbors search performed the best.
